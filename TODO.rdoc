= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for Oklahoma Mixer in the order I
intend to address them.

1. Include some higher level abstractions like mixed tables, queues, and shards
2. Add support for Tokyo Tyrant
3. Ensure Ruby 1.9 compatibility
4. Write API documentation
5. Add support for Tokyo Dystopia
