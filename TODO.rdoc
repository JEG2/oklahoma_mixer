= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for Oklahoma Mixer in the order I
intend to address them.

1. Resolve minor issues
  * Speed up counts (fetch keys only to prevent HashMap conversion)
  * Push :select down into all() call to speed up paginate()
2. Include some higher level abstractions like mixed tables, queues, and shards
3. Add support for Tokyo Tyrant
4. Ensure Ruby 1.9 compatibility
5. Write API documentation
6. Add support for Tokyo Dystopia
